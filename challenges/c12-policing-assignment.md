*Purpose*: In this last challenge we’ll focus on using logistic
regression to study a large, complicated dataset. Interpreting the
results of a model can be challenging—both in terms of the statistics
and the real-world reasoning—so we’ll get some practice in this
challenge.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Needs Improvement | Satisfactory |
|----|----|----|
| Effort | Some task **q**’s left unattempted | All task **q**’s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations, or observations incorrect | Documented correct observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not clearly supported by analysis | All observations clearly supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Assessed | Observations include claims not supported by the data, or reflect a level of certainty not warranted by the data | Observations are appropriately qualified by the quality & relevance of the data and (in)conclusiveness of the support |
| Specified | Uses the phrase “more data are necessary” without clarification | Any statement that “more data are necessary” specifies which *specific* data are needed to answer what *specific* question |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

## Submission

<!-- ------------------------- -->

Make sure to commit both the challenge report (`report.md` file) and
supporting files (`report_files/` folder) when you are done! Then submit
a link to Canvas. **Your Challenge submission is not complete without
all files uploaded to GitHub.**

*Background*: We’ll study data from the [Stanford Open Policing
Project](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/), specifically their
dataset on Massachusetts State Patrol police stops.

# Setup

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

### **q1** Go to the [Stanford Open Policing Project](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/) page and download the Massachusetts State Police records in `Rds` format. Move the data to your `data` folder and match the `filename` to load the data.

*Note*: An `Rds` file is an R-specific file format. The function
`readRDS` will read these files.

``` r
## TODO: Download the data, move to your data folder, and load it
filename <- "./data/ma_statewide_2020_04_01.rds"
df_data <- readRDS(filename)
```

# EDA

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

### **q2** Do your “first checks” on the dataset. What are the basic facts about this dataset?

``` r
glimpse(df_data)
```

**Observations**:

- What are the basic facts about this dataset?
  - the columns, generally, are the following
    - raw_row_number (chr) for enumeration
    - date (date), location (chr) and county (name) for where and when
      the police stop happened
    - subject appearance data: subject_age (int),
      subject_race(white,hispanic etc.), subject_sex (male/female)
    - type (vehicular etc.) of stop and if vehicle then vehicle_type
      (chr)
    - binary true or false if an arrest was made, if a citation was
      issued, or if a warning was issued
    - binary true or false if contraband was found and whether it was
      drugs, weapons, alcohol or other

Note that we have both a `subject_race` and `race_Raw` column. There are
a few possibilities as to what `race_Raw` represents:

- `race_Raw` could be the race of the police officer in the stop
- `race_Raw` could be an unprocessed version of `subject_race`

Let’s try to distinguish between these two possibilities.

### **q3** Check the set of factor levels for `subject_race` and `raw_Race`. What do you note about overlap / difference between the two sets?

``` r
## TODO: Determine the factor levels for subject_race and raw_Race
df_data %>%
  distinct(raw_Race)
```

    ## # A tibble: 9 × 1
    ##   raw_Race                                     
    ##   <chr>                                        
    ## 1 White                                        
    ## 2 Hispanic                                     
    ## 3 Black                                        
    ## 4 Asian or Pacific Islander                    
    ## 5 Middle Eastern or East Indian (South Asian)  
    ## 6 American Indian or Alaskan Native            
    ## 7 <NA>                                         
    ## 8 None - for no operator present citations only
    ## 9 A

``` r
df_data %>%
  distinct(subject_race)
```

    ## # A tibble: 7 × 1
    ##   subject_race          
    ##   <fct>                 
    ## 1 white                 
    ## 2 hispanic              
    ## 3 black                 
    ## 4 asian/pacific islander
    ## 5 other                 
    ## 6 <NA>                  
    ## 7 unknown

**Observations**:

- What are the unique values for `subject_race`?
  - white
  - hispanic
  - black
  - asian/pacific islander
  - other
  - NA
  - unknown
- What are the unique values for `raw_Race`?
  - White
  - Hispanic
  - Black
  - Asian or Pacific Islander
  - Middle Eastern or East Indian (South Asian)
  - American Indian or Alaskan Native
  - NA
  - None - for no operator present citations only
  - A
- What is the overlap between the two sets?
  - White, Hispanic, Black, Asian or Pacific Islander, Other, NA
- What is the difference between the two sets?
  - Middle Eastern or East Indian (South Asian), American Indian or
    Alaskan Native, A, None, Unknown (but these last two might be
    synonymous)

### **q4** Check whether `subject_race` and `raw_Race` match for a large fraction of cases. Which of the two hypotheses above is most likely, based on your results?

*Note*: Just to be clear, I’m *not* asking you to do a *statistical*
hypothesis test.

``` r
## TODO: Devise your own way to test the hypothesis posed above.
```

**Observations**

Between the two hypotheses:

- `race_Raw` could be the race of the police officer in the stop
- `race_Raw` could be an unprocessed version of `subject_race`

which is most plausible, based on your results?

- (Your response here)

## Vis

<!-- ------------------------- -->

### **q5** Compare the *arrest rate*—the fraction of total cases in which the subject was arrested—across different factors. Create as many visuals (or tables) as you need, but make sure to check the trends across all of the `subject` variables. Answer the questions under *observations* below.

(Note: Create as many chunks and visuals as you need)

**Observations**:

- How does `arrest_rate` tend to vary with `subject_age`?
  - (Your response here)
- How does `arrest_rate` tend to vary with `subject_sex`?
  - (Your response here)
- How does `arrest_rate` tend to vary with `subject_race`?
  - (Your response here)

# Modeling

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

We’re going to use a model to study the relationship between `subject`
factors and arrest rate, but first we need to understand a bit more
about *dummy variables*

### **q6** Run the following code and interpret the regression coefficients. Answer the the questions under *observations* below.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit; inspect the estimated model terms.
# fit_q6 <-
#   glm(
#     formula = arrest_made ~ subject_age + subject_race + subject_sex,
#     data = df_data %>%
#       filter(
#         !is.na(arrest_made),
#         subject_race %in% c("white", "black", "hispanic")
#       ),
#     family = "binomial"
#   )
# 
# fit_q6 %>% tidy()
```

**Observations**:

- Which `subject_race` levels are included in fitting the model?
  - (Your response here)
- Which `subject_race` levels have terms in the model?
  - (Your response here)

You should find that each factor in the model has a level *missing* in
its set of terms. This is because R represents factors against a
*reference level*: The model treats one factor level as “default”, and
each factor model term represents a change from that “default” behavior.
For instance, the model above treats `subject_sex==male` as the
reference level, so the `subject_sexfemale` term represents the *change
in probability* of arrest due to a person being female (rather than
male).

The this reference level approach to coding factors is necessary for
[technical
reasons](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/achoulde/94842/lectures/lecture10/lecture10-94842.html#why-is-one-of-the-levels-missing-in-the-regression),
but it complicates interpreting the model results. For instance; if we
want to compare two levels, neither of which are the reference level, we
have to consider the difference in their model coefficients. But if we
want to compare all levels against one “baseline” level, then we can
relevel the data to facilitate this comparison.

By default `glm` uses the first factor level present as the reference
level. Therefore we can use
`mutate(factor = fct_relevel(factor, "desired_level"))` to set our
`"desired_level"` as the reference factor.

### **q7** Re-fit the logistic regression from q6 setting `"white"` as the reference level for `subject_race`. Interpret the the model terms and answer the questions below.

``` r
## TODO: Re-fit the logistic regression, but set "white" as the reference
## level for subject_race

# fit_q7 %>% tidy()
```

**Observations**:

- Which `subject_race` level has the highest probability of being
  arrested, according to this model? Which has the lowest probability?
  - (Your response here)
- What could explain this difference in probabilities of arrest across
  race? List **multiple** possibilities.
  - (Your response here)
- Look at the set of variables in the dataset; do any of the columns
  relate to a potential explanation you listed?
  - (Your response here)

One way we can explain differential arrest rates is to include some
measure indicating the presence of an arrestable offense. We’ll do this
in a particular way in the next task.

### **q8** Re-fit the model using a factor indicating the presence of contraband in the subject’s vehicle. Answer the questions under *observations* below.

``` r
## TODO: Repeat the modeling above, but control for whether contraband was found
## during the police stop
# fit_q8 %>% tidy()
```

**Observations**:

- How does controlling for found contraband affect the `subject_race`
  terms in the model?
  - (Your response here)
- What does the *finding of contraband* tell us about the stop? What
  does it *not* tell us about the stop?
  - (Your response here)

### **q9** Go deeper: Pose at least one more question about the data and fit at least one more model in support of answering that question.

**Observations**:

- Document your question and findings
