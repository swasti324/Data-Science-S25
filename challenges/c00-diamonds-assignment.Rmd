*Purpose*: Throughout this course, you'll complete a large number of *exercises* and *challenges*. Exercises are meant to introduce content with easy-to-solve problems, while challenges are meant to make you think more deeply about and apply the content. The challenges will start out highly-scaffolded, and become progressively open-ended.

In this challenge, you will go through the process of exploring, documenting, and sharing an analysis of a dataset. We will use these skills again and again in each challenge.

*Note*: You will have seen all of these steps in `e-vis00-basics`. This challenge is *primarily* a practice run of the submission system. The Data Exploration part should be very simple.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Needs Improvement | Satisfactory |
|----|----|----|
| Effort | Some task **q**'s left unattempted | All task **q**'s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations, or observations incorrect | Documented correct observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not clearly supported by analysis | All observations clearly supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Assessed | Observations include claims not supported by the data, or reflect a level of certainty not warranted by the data | Observations are appropriately qualified by the quality & relevance of the data and (in)conclusiveness of the support |
| Specified | Uses the phrase "more data are necessary" without clarification | Any statement that "more data are necessary" specifies which *specific* data are needed to answer what *specific* question |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

## Submission

<!-- ------------------------- -->

Make sure to commit both the challenge report (`report.md` file) and supporting files (`report_files/` folder) when you are done! Then submit a link to Canvas. **Your Challenge submission is not complete without all files uploaded to GitHub.**

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
```

# Data Exploration

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

In this first stage, you will explore the `diamonds` dataset and document your observations.

### **q1** Create a plot of `price` vs `carat` of the `diamonds` dataset below. Document your observations from the visual.

*Hint*: We learned how to do this in `e-vis00-basics`!

```{r q1-task}
## TASK: Plot `price` vs `carat` below

diamonds %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(
      x = carat,
      y = price
    )
  )
```

**Observations**:

-   noticeable upwards trend. Even still there is a huge range for the 1-2 carat diamonds. There must be other factors that determine how valuable a diamond is since one 2 carat diamond could cost \$5000 and another nearly \$20000

### **q2** Create a visualization showing variables `carat`, `price`, and `cut` simultaneously. Experiment with which variable you assign to which aesthetic (`x`, `y`, etc.) to find an effective visual.

```{r q2-task}
## TASK: Plot `price`, `carat`, and `cut` below
diamonds %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(
      x = carat,
      y = price,
      color = cut
    )
  )
```

**Observations**:

-   The color represents the category of cut. There is certainly an association with an ideal cut (yellow) resulting in a more expensive diamond and vice versa where a fair cut (purple) results in a less expensive diamond. Yet there is still a considerable amount of variability. It is still possible to find a diamond that is an ideal cut AND over 2 carats and strike a deal of under \$10000 compared to that joint category of diamonds average price range to be over \$15000. What is most peculiar is that beyond the 2 carat range, the distinction between a premium cut (green) and ideal cut (yellow) is blurred.

# Communication

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

In this next stage, you will render your data exploration, push it to GitHub to share with others, and link your observations within our [Data Science Wiki](https://olin-data-science.fandom.com/wiki/Olin_Data_Science_Wiki).

### **q3** *Knit* your document in order to create a report.

You can do this by clicking the "Knit" button at the top of your document in RStudio.

![Terminal](./images/c00-knit.png)

This will create a local `.md` file, and RStudio will automatically open a preview window so you can view your knitted document.

### **q4** *Push* your knitted document to GitHub.

![Terminal](./images/c00-unstaged.png)

You will need to stage both the `.md` file, as well as the `_files` folder. Note that the `_files` folder, when staged, will expand to include all the files under that directory.

![Terminal](./images/c00-staged.png)

### **q5** *Submit* your work to Canvas

Navigate to your GitHub repository's website and find the URL that corresponds to your report. Submit this to Canvas to complete the assignment.

### **q6** *Prepare* to present your team's findings!

If your team is on-deck, you are responsible for putting together a discussion of the challenge. I'll demonstrate how to do this by leading the discussion of Challenge 0.
